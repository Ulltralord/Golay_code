# Golay_code

This is a software implementation of the binary Golay code with parameters [24, 12, 8].

The program generates a message, which is converted into a code word using a matrix. After that, errors are added to it. Using the Golay code, errors are corrected and the original word is calculated, which is then converted into the original message by discarding the last 12 bits.
